    title: "Description",
    content: `He created this painting based on a natural sketch created along the Oxtongue River in Algonquin Park. It was not a commissioned work and he was just inspired to create this based on the Candians autumn outdoor wilderness and landscape. It also showcases the red maple leaf which is a major Canadian symbol that is known to represent the canadian identity. 

A.Y. Jackson has a Post-Impressionist style which is a way of painting that tries to portray more feeling, movement  and emotion in the painting by using bright and bold colours(like blue and red), thick brushstroke (show movement of the waves in the lake and the way the wind blows the leaves)  and shapes that are over exaggerated. This painting is created by using oil mixed with coloured pigments on a canvas. The genre of the painting is landscape as it portrays an image of the outdoors. 

This painting can be found in the National Gallery of Canada art museum in Ottawa. (Built in 1988 and holds many indigenous and Canadian artwork in the world).
