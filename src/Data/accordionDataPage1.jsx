    content: `Diego Riviera was a <span>Mexican Muralist </span>(heavily inspired
            by socialist realism) responsible for the painting “Man, Controller
            of the Universe (1934)”; a mural reflecting the historically
            defining progress mankind was making politically and technologically
            in that era. The painting has a rich history that presents us with a
            glimpse into the entangled relationship between art and politics.
            The piece was originally commissioned by Nelson Rockerfeller for the
            Rockerfeller center in New York City. However, after it was
            complete, the inclusion of Vladimir Lenin was seen as controversial;
            a consequence of the first red scare in America. Riviera’s refusal
            to remove the depiction of Lenin was seen as “un-American” by
            Rockerfeller, who had the piece destroyed. Riviera repainted the
            piece, which is now displayed in the Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico
            City.`,

    title: "Description",
    content: `It was completed in the fresco medium; water based paint applied
            directly to plaster on a 480 cm × 1145 cm canvas. The painting is
            divided into 2 halves, the left side depicting bourgeois society and
            military, and the right side depicting revolutionary protesters. In
            the center of the painting is a man holding a controller while
            standing under a huge machine, next to a microscope, above a pipe
            with growths of vegetation, and behind a large hand holding a
            mechanical sphere. Cascades of light burst forth from the sphere,
            each containing a depiction of the cosmos or of microscopic
            organisms. This is a direct reference to the title of the work and a
            testament to Riviera’s socialist beliefs; an everyday laborer is
            depicted as being the controller of the universe and driver of
            history while surrounded by mankind's achievements bursting forth
            from machines. The purpose of Mexican Muralism was to build
            community by communicating social and political messages through
            art. The political message within this particular piece was so
            strong that it resulted in censorship; the piece had become a real
            representation of the clash between revolutionary forces and
            reactionaries. Riviera incorporated symmetrical balance, rhythm, and
            shape to draw the viewer to the center. These principles also help
            in establishing the juxtaposing halves of the painting.`,
