    content: `Diego Rivera was a Mexican Muralist (heavily inspired
            by socialist realism) responsible for the painting “Man, Controller
            of the Universe (1934)”; a mural reflecting the historically
            defining progress mankind was making politically and technologically
            in that era. The painting has a rich history that presents us with a
            glimpse into the entangled relationship between art and politics.
            The piece was originally commissioned by Nelson Rockerfeller for the
            Rockerfeller center in New York City. However, after it was
            complete, the inclusion of Vladimir Lenin was seen as controversial;
            a consequence of the first red scare in America. Rivera’s refusal
            to remove the depiction of Lenin was seen as “un-American” by
            Rockerfeller, who had the piece destroyed. Rivera repainted the
            piece, which is now displayed in the Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico
            City.`,

    content: `It was completed in the fresco medium; water based paint applied
            directly to plaster on a 480 cm × 1145 cm canvas. The painting is
            divided into 2 halves, the left side depicting bourgeois society and
            military, and the right side depicting revolutionary protesters. In
            the center of the painting is a man holding a controller while
            standing under a huge machine, next to a microscope, above a pipe
            with growths of vegetation, and behind a large hand holding a
            mechanical sphere. Cascades of light burst forth from the sphere,
            each containing a depiction of the cosmos or of microscopic
            organisms. This is a direct reference to the title of the work and a
            testament to Rivera’s socialist beliefs; an everyday laborer is
            depicted as being the controller of the universe and driver of
            history while surrounded by mankind's achievements bursting forth
            from machines. The purpose of Mexican Muralism was to build
            community by communicating social and political messages through
            art. The political message within this particular piece was so
            strong that it resulted in censorship; the piece had become a real
            representation of the clash between revolutionary forces and
            reactionaries. Rivera incorporated symmetrical balance, rhythm, and
            shape to draw the viewer to the center. These principles also help
            in establishing the juxtaposing halves of the painting.`,

This painting is now held in the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, while many of the artist's other works are in the MoMA. It is painted with oilstick, spray, and acrylic on a 172.72 x 259.08 cm canvas. 
The painting depicts 3 figures chaotically scribbled onto the page. The left figure shows a character bound by chains and bars in an asbestos filled room. The 2 figures on the right are donned in iconic American garb (top hats) and surrounded by dollar signs; the message in the middle of the canvas reads "not for sale”. 
Basquiat used color, space, and movement to guide the eye through a chaotic and visceral piece. Contrast between red, blue, and white emphasizes the forms while also representing America. The black figure represents the sequestering and imprisonment of black americans. He was not shy about using written words in his work, which brought forth additional clarity and harkens back to his roots as a graffiti artist. 
This painting is a reflection of Basquiat's own frustration with capitalist co-option of the art industry, which reduced artwork to mere commodities (which is ironic given the record-breaking auction prices his work fetched).

Lenardo da Vinci carefully captured each of the disciples' emotions with the painting that already tells us a story by just looking at it.  This painting was commissioned by the Duke of Milan (another word to often used to refer to as the emperor or ruler of Milan, a city in Italy) named Ludovico Sforza. Ludovico loved art and was rich and powerful so he paid Lenerado to paint this painting. The Last Supper is a mural painting (a type of artwork that is painted or applied directly on to a wall or ceiling and cannot be moved). He painted it using tempera (which is a painting technique that mixes pigments things like water and egg yolk) and oil paint on a dry wall. The style of the painting is High Renaissance which was a period in art where artists create realistic and detailed art, to show emotions and movement. The genre of the painting is religious as it used to represent a biblical time. 


The museum that to this day still has the painting is in the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. (This is a well known church located in the heart of the city, Milan visited by many tourists. Built in 1469 and finished in 1482)

This painting is created by using oil mixed with coloured pigments on a canvas. The genre of the painting is landscape as it portrays an image of the outdoors.

With their swords raised, they make a solemn vow in front of their father, symbolizing honor, sacrifice, and patriotism.
The composition emphasizes strong lines, dramatic lighting, and a sense of stoic resolve, which reflect the ideals of the Enlightenment, such as duty, virtue, and civic responsibility. The contrasting emotions of the brothers' determination and the sorrow of their women highlight the tension between personal sacrifice and familial bonds. The painting became a powerful symbol of the French Revolution’s ideals, promoting the notion of collective duty over individual desire.

Starry Night was painted during a period of intense personal difficulty for van Gogh. In 1888, van Gogh suffered a mental breakdown, culminating in the infamous incident where he cut off part of his own ear. After this event, he voluntarily admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France, where he painted Starry Night. The view from the asylum window, which inspired the painting, was the subject of many of his works during this time. Van Gogh often painted scenes he observed from his window, interpreting them in his distinctive style.
Although Starry Night is not a direct representation of the view from his window, it is heavily influenced by the landscape. Van Gogh painted a fantastical, dreamlike version of the scene, filled with swirling stars and a luminous crescent moon. The cypress tree in the foreground, which has often been noted for its symbolic meaning, was also visible from his window. The sweeping sky, full of energy and motion, is painted with thick, expressive brushstrokes, which were a hallmark of van Gogh’s later work. His technique of impasto, where paint is applied thickly to create texture, is evident in Starry Night, giving the work a sense of depth and vitality.

Van Gogh’s style in Starry Night marks a departure from traditional landscape painting. The swirling forms of the sky and the exaggerated colors reflect his emotional and psychological state. The contrasting colors of deep blues and bright yellows, along with the tumultuous swirling patterns in the sky, evoke a sense of both chaos and beauty. The brushstrokes are thick and energetic, creating a sense of movement that mirrors the turbulence van Gogh was experiencing in his personal life. His use of bold, non-naturalistic color was revolutionary at the time and contributed to the development of Expressionism in art.
The painting’s composition is also notable for its juxtaposition of the calm, serene village below and the dynamic, almost violent sky above. This contrast could reflect van Gogh's internal conflict, torn between peaceful domestic life and the overwhelming force of his emotions. The cypress tree, often seen as a symbol of death, reaches up toward the sky, perhaps symbolizing van Gogh’s longing for connection with something greater, or even an attempt to escape his earthly struggles.

When van Gogh painted Starry Night, he was still relatively unknown as an artist. He spent most of his life in poverty, and his works were not widely appreciated during his time. In fact, Starry Night was never sold during his lifetime. Van Gogh’s reputation began to grow posthumously, and today he is considered one of the most important figures in Western art history. Starry Night has become a symbol of his brilliance and tragic life. It embodies both the beauty and madness that defined his artistic journey.
The painting’s importance extends beyond the art world. It has been reproduced on countless products, from posters to clothing, making it one of the most recognizable images in popular culture. Starry Night also continues to inspire new generations of artists and art lovers, and its presence in MoMA ensures that it remains a central part of the conversation about van Gogh’s legacy.
In conclusion, Starry Night is not just a beautiful work of art—it reflects van Gogh’s turbulent emotional landscape and his desire to convey his inner turmoil through the language of color and form. Despite its creation during a time of personal hardship, Starry Night stands as a testament to van Gogh’s enduring creativity and his ability to transform suffering into something sublime.

American Gothic was created at a time when the United States was struggling with the effects of the Great Depression, which began in 1929. Grant Wood, an artist based in Iowa, sought to capture the resilience of the rural working class. The painting was inspired by a trip Wood made to Eldon, Iowa, where he saw a small farmhouse built in the Gothic Revival style. This house, with its steep roof and pointed windows, served as the backdrop for the piece. Wood felt that the farmhouse's architecture symbolized the strength and enduring qualities of rural America.
Wood, who was heavily influenced by European and American art movements, notably the Regionalist movement, was drawn to depicting ordinary people in everyday situations. He sought to create an image that embodied traditional American values and the hardworking nature of rural life. The subjects of the painting are his dentist, Dr. Byron McKeeby, and his sister, Nan Wood Graham, who posed for the work. Wood's decision to use a dentist and his sister as models, rather than actual farmers, contributed to the painting’s somewhat enigmatic quality. The two figures in the painting stand rigidly and are dressed in a manner that reflects the conservative, practical nature of the rural Midwestern lifestyle.

In American Gothic, Wood employed a highly detailed and realistic style. His technique draws from both Northern Renaissance art and the precision of 20th-century American realism. The composition of the painting is symmetrical and tightly structured, with the figures placed in the foreground and the house forming a strong architectural background. The severe expressions on the farmer and his daughter add to the painting’s sense of gravity and formality, contributing to its sense of stoic resilience.
Wood’s use of color is subdued but powerful. The earth tones in the clothing and the building contrast with the brighter, crisp white of the house, emphasizing the isolation of the figures. The stern faces of the farmer and his daughter reflect the hardships of rural life during the Depression, yet they also convey a sense of quiet determination. The rigid poses of the figures suggest that they are bound to the land, working tirelessly to maintain their way of life. The Gothic windows of the farmhouse behind them also create a sense of verticality, reinforcing the themes of structure and endurance.

When Wood completed American Gothic in 1930, it quickly became a symbol of the American heartland and the values of self-reliance and fortitude that were associated with rural life. The painting was first exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago, where it won a prestigious award and was purchased by the museum. The work’s success marked the height of Wood’s career, and American Gothic became a defining example of American Regionalism, a movement that sought to depict the rural and small-town life of America in a realistic and accessible manner.
Despite its initial success, American Gothic has been subject to a variety of interpretations over the years. Some critics have viewed the painting as a satirical comment on the rigidity and conservatism of rural life, while others have seen it as a celebration of traditional values and hard work. The stoic expressions of the figures, along with the barren surroundings, have led some to interpret the painting as a commentary on the struggles of rural Americans during the Great Depression, while others argue that it emphasizes the dignity and strength of the working class.
In popular culture, American Gothic has been parodied and referenced countless times, often in a humorous or ironic context. Its portrayal of the farmer and his daughter has been used in everything from political cartoons to advertisements, making it one of the most enduring images in American art. The painting’s legacy is as much about the cultural impact it has had as it is about its artistic achievements.
In conclusion, American Gothic remains one of the most significant works in American art, encapsulating the essence of rural America during a time of economic hardship. Grant Wood’s ability to depict the dignity, strength, and sometimes harsh realities of rural life has ensured that the painting continues to resonate with viewers today. Whether viewed as a celebration of American values or a critique of small-town conservatism, American Gothic is a powerful and enduring image of the American spirit.
