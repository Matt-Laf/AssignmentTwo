    content: `Diego Rivera was a Mexican Muralist (heavily inspired
            by socialist realism) responsible for the painting “Man, Controller
            of the Universe (1934)”; a mural reflecting the historically
            defining progress mankind was making politically and technologically
            in that era. The painting has a rich history that presents us with a
            glimpse into the entangled relationship between art and politics.
            The piece was originally commissioned by Nelson Rockerfeller for the
            Rockerfeller center in New York City. However, after it was
            complete, the inclusion of Vladimir Lenin was seen as controversial;
            a consequence of the first red scare in America. Rivera’s refusal
            to remove the depiction of Lenin was seen as “un-American” by
            Rockerfeller, who had the piece destroyed. Rivera repainted the
            piece, which is now displayed in the Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico
            City.`,

    content: `It was completed in the fresco medium; water based paint applied
            directly to plaster on a 480 cm × 1145 cm canvas. The painting is
            divided into 2 halves, the left side depicting bourgeois society and
            military, and the right side depicting revolutionary protesters. In
            the center of the painting is a man holding a controller while
            standing under a huge machine, next to a microscope, above a pipe
            with growths of vegetation, and behind a large hand holding a
            mechanical sphere. Cascades of light burst forth from the sphere,
            each containing a depiction of the cosmos or of microscopic
            organisms. This is a direct reference to the title of the work and a
            testament to Rivera’s socialist beliefs; an everyday laborer is
            depicted as being the controller of the universe and driver of
            history while surrounded by mankind's achievements bursting forth
            from machines. The purpose of Mexican Muralism was to build
            community by communicating social and political messages through
            art. The political message within this particular piece was so
            strong that it resulted in censorship; the piece had become a real
            representation of the clash between revolutionary forces and
            reactionaries. Rivera incorporated symmetrical balance, rhythm, and
            shape to draw the viewer to the center. These principles also help
            in establishing the juxtaposing halves of the painting.`,

    content: `The painting gives a glimpse into the mind of an artist from the Haitian diaspora growing up in Reagan era America, full of racial tensions, gentrification, and the widespread application of neoliberal policies and privatization. 
This painting is now held in the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, while many of the artist's other works are in the MoMA. It is painted with oilstick, spray, and acrylic on a 172.72 x 259.08 cm canvas. 
The painting depicts 3 figures chaotically scribbled onto the page. The left figure shows a character bound by chains and bars in an asbestos filled room. The 2 figures on the right are donned in iconic American garb (top hats) and surrounded by dollar signs; the message in the middle of the canvas reads "not for sale”. 
Basquiat used color, space, and movement to guide the eye through a chaotic and visceral piece. Contrast between red, blue, and white emphasizes the forms while also representing America. The black figure represents the sequestering and imprisonment of black americans. He was not shy about using written words in his work, which brought forth additional clarity and harkens back to his roots as a graffiti artist. 
This painting is a reflection of Basquiat's own frustration with capitalist co-option of the art industry, which reduced artwork to mere commodities (which is ironic given the record-breaking auction prices his work fetched).

    content: `This painting was created to demonstrate the twelve disciples' confusion and uneasiness when they found out that one of them was going to betray Jesus. Lenardo da Vinci carefully captured each of the disciples' emotions with the painting that already tells us a story by just looking at it.  This painting was commissioned by the Duke of Milan (another word to often used to refer to as the emperor or ruler of Milan, a city in Italy) named Ludovico Sforza. Ludovico loved art and was rich and powerful so he paid Lenerado to paint this painting. The Last Supper is a mural painting (a type of artwork that is painted or applied directly on to a wall or ceiling and cannot be moved). He painted it using tempera (which is a painting technique that mixes pigments things like water and egg yolk) and oil paint on a dry wall. The style of the painting is High Renaissance which was a period in art where artists create realistic and detailed art, to show emotions and movement. The genre of the painting is religious as it used to represent a biblical time. 


The museum that to this day still has the painting is in the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. (This is a well known church located in the heart of the city, Milan visited by many tourists. Built in 1469 and finished in 1482)

It was not a commissioned work and he was just inspired to create this based on the Candians autumn outdoor wilderness and landscape. It also showcases the red maple leaf which is a major Canadian symbol that is known to represent the canadian identity. 

A.Y. Jackson has a Post-Impressionist style which is a way of painting that tries to portray more feeling, movement  and emotion in the painting by using bright and bold colours(like blue and red), thick brushstroke (show movement of the waves in the lake and the way the wind blows the leaves)  and shapes that are over exaggerated. This painting is created by using oil mixed with coloured pigments on a canvas. The genre of the painting is landscape as it portrays an image of the outdoors. 

This painting can be found in the National Gallery of Canada art museum in Ottawa. (Built in 1988 and holds many indigenous and Canadian artwork in the world).

The painting depicts a pivotal moment from ancient Roman history, where three brothers from the Horatii family swear an oath to defend their city, Rome, against their enemies, the Curatii. With their swords raised, they make a solemn vow in front of their father, symbolizing honor, sacrifice, and patriotism.
The composition emphasizes strong lines, dramatic lighting, and a sense of stoic resolve, which reflect the ideals of the Enlightenment, such as duty, virtue, and civic responsibility. The contrasting emotions of the brothers' determination and the sorrow of their women highlight the tension between personal sacrifice and familial bonds. The painting became a powerful symbol of the French Revolution’s ideals, promoting the notion of collective duty over individual desire.
