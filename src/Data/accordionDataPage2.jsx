    title: "Description",
    content: `The painting gives a glimpse into the mind of an artist from the Haitian diaspora growing up in Reagan era America, full of racial tensions, gentrification, and the widespread application of neoliberal policies and privatization. 
This painting is now held in the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, while many of the artist's other works are in the MoMA. It is painted with oilstick, spray, and acrylic on a 172.72 x 259.08 cm canvas. 
The painting depicts 3 figures chaotically scribbled onto the page. The left figure shows a character bound by chains and bars in an asbestos filled room. The 2 figures on the right are donned in iconic American garb (top hats) and surrounded by dollar signs; the message in the middle of the canvas reads "not for sale”. 
Basquiat used color, space, and movement to guide the eye through a chaotic and visceral piece. Contrast between red, blue, and white emphasizes the forms while also representing America. The black figure represents the sequestering and imprisonment of black americans. He was not shy about using written words in his work, which brought forth additional clarity and harkens back to his roots as a graffiti artist. 
This painting is a reflection of Basquiat's own frustration with capitalist co-option of the art industry, which reduced artwork to mere commodities (which is ironic given the record-breaking auction prices his work fetched).
