    title: "Description",
    content: `This painting was created to demonstrate the twelve disciples' confusion and uneasiness when they found out that one of them was going to betray Jesus. Lenardo da Vinci carefully captured each of the disciples' emotions with the painting that already tells us a story by just looking at it.  This painting was commissioned by the Duke of Milan (another word to often used to refer to as the emperor or ruler of Milan, a city in Italy) named Ludovico Sforza. Ludovico loved art and was rich and powerful so he paid Lenerado to paint this painting. The Last Supper is a mural painting (a type of artwork that is painted or applied directly on to a wall or ceiling and cannot be moved). He painted it using tempera (which is a painting technique that mixes pigments things like water and egg yolk) and oil paint on a dry wall. The style of the painting is High Renaissance which was a period in art where artists create realistic and detailed art, to show emotions and movement. The genre of the painting is religious as it used to represent a biblical time. 


The museum that to this day still has the painting is in the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. (This is a well known church located in the heart of the city, Milan visited by many tourists. Built in 1469 and finished in 1482)
