          <p>
            By examining these works of art, we hope you have come to realize
            how a variety of visuals and aesthetic choices are born from and
            interact with our world. Through interactive exploration, this book
            has encouraged a deeper engagement with these artworks â€” positioning
            them as a vehicle from which to examine history and society. The
            connections we make between images, ideas, and the world at large,
            will inevitably reflect in our interpretations of art.
